# Backend: Mammography analysis
This project consists of the implementation of a web image processing and analysis service provided by the University of Louisville.
This repository contains the code corresponding to the web server that will serve an user, attending their requests, allowing them to upload images that are the result of mammograms, either in .dcom or .png format, to be processed by the work team of the Research and Innovation Laboratory of the University of Louisville Speed School of Engineering.
The web application is developed with JavaScript, using the React library.
